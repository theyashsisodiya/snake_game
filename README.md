# JavaScript Snake Game

You can now play and edit the game live in under proces: 
xyz.com

On first load sometimes the game frame will not load correctly and you'll need to press the refresh icon above its display panel to get the game to show. 


## How to use
The index.html file should give an idea of how to use this code. However, below you can see how to initialize it into any div within a webpage.

    var mySnakeBoard = new SNAKE.Board( {
                                            boardContainer: "game-area",
                                            fullScreen: false,
                                            width: 580,
                                            height:400
                                        });
